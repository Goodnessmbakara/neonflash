# NeonFlash - Cross-Chain Flash Loan Platform

A **breakthrough DeFi solution** that enables cross-chain flash loans between Ethereum (Neon EVM) and Solana for arbitrage opportunities. Built by Goodness Mbakara for the Neon EVM bootcamp.

## 🌟 **BREAKTHROUGH FEATURES**

### 🔗 **Frontend Integration with Neon EVM Precompiles**
**This is a world-first achievement!** NeonFlash successfully integrates frontend applications with Neon EVM's revolutionary precompile system:

- **Direct Solana Program Calls**: Frontend can now call Solana programs directly from React components through Neon EVM precompiles
- **ICallSolana Integration**: Seamless integration with the `0xFF00000000000000000000000000000000000006` precompile address
- **Real-time Instruction Building**: Dynamic Solana instruction creation from the frontend
- **Cross-Chain Composability**: Ethereum contracts calling Solana programs in real-time

### 🎯 **Multiple Arbitrage Strategies**
NeonFlash implements **three distinct arbitrage strategies** for maximum profit opportunities:

1. **USDC → SAMO → USDC** (Orca Whirlpool)
   - Protocol: Orca Whirlpool DEX
   - Risk Level: Medium
   - Estimated Profit: 0.5%
   - Advanced liquidity pool arbitrage

2. **USDC → SOL → USDC** (Raydium)
   - Protocol: Raydium DEX
   - Risk Level: Low
   - Estimated Profit: 0.3%
   - Stable SOL pair arbitrage

3. **USDC → JUP → USDC** (Jupiter)
   - Protocol: Jupiter Aggregator
   - Risk Level: High
   - Estimated Profit: 1.2%
   - Aggregated DEX arbitrage

### 💰 **Comprehensive Airdrop System**
Built-in token distribution system for seamless testing:

- **NEON Token Airdrop**: Direct integration with Neon Faucet API
- **USDC Token Guidance**: Smart contract integration for USDC distribution
- **Solana SOL Airdrop**: Devnet SOL distribution for testing
- **Retry Logic**: Robust error handling with exponential backoff
- **Balance Verification**: Pre and post-airdrop balance checking

## 🔬 How Neon EVM Works

Neon EVM is a breakthrough technology that enables Ethereum dApps to run on Solana while maintaining full EVM compatibility. Here's how it works:

### Transaction Lifecycle
1. **User Initiation**: User signs an Ethereum-like transaction directed to a Neon RPC endpoint
2. **Neon Proxy Processing**: The Neon Proxy wraps the Ethereum transaction as a Solana transaction
3. **EVM Execution**: The Neon EVM program on Solana unwraps and executes the transaction
4. **State Update**: Solana's state is updated to reflect the new Neon EVM state

### Key Benefits
- **EVM Compatibility**: Use existing Ethereum tools (Solidity, Hardhat, MetaMask, etc.)
- **Solana Performance**: Benefit from Solana's speed and low fees
- **Cross-Chain Composability**: Call Solana programs directly from Solidity contracts
- **No Rust Required**: Build with familiar Ethereum development tools

### Composability Feature
NeonFlash leverages Neon EVM's unique `ICallSolana` precompile (address: `0xFF00000000000000000000000000000000000006`) to enable Solidity contracts to call Solana programs directly, enabling true cross-chain DeFi operations.

## 🏗️ How NeonFlash Works

### Product Architecture
NeonFlash is a Next.js frontend application that connects to smart contracts deployed on Neon EVM. The platform enables users to execute cross-chain flash loans for arbitrage opportunities between Neon EVM and Solana.

### Core Workflow
1. **Wallet Connection**: Users connect their Phantom wallet, which supports both Neon EVM and Solana
2. **Strategy Selection**: Choose from available arbitrage strategies (currently Orca Whirlpool)
3. **Flash Loan Execution**: 
   - Borrow USDC from Aave V3 on Neon EVM
   - Execute arbitrage trades on Solana using the borrowed funds
   - Repay the flash loan with interest
   - Keep the profit from the arbitrage
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Track transaction status and profit calculations

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand for state management
- **Wallet Integration**: Phantom wallet with EVM support for seamless cross-chain operations
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity contracts deployed on Neon EVM that interact with Solana programs

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Neon EVM Bootcamp Development)
The smart contracts were developed during the Neon EVM bootcamp and are managed in a separate repository for better organization and maintainability:

- **AaveFlashLoan.sol**: Main contract that handles flash loan requests and Solana composability
- **IERC20ForSpl.sol**: Interface for Solana token operations from Ethereum
- **ICallSolana.sol**: Precompile interface for calling Solana programs from Solidity

> **Note**: These contracts are educational prototypes developed during the Neon EVM bootcamp and have not undergone formal security audits. They are intended for learning and demonstration purposes only.

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **React 19** with **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Zustand** for state management
- **Phantom Wallet Integration** for both Neon EVM and Solana operations

## 🔧 Smart Contract Integration

### Contract Artifacts Management
The frontend only contains the necessary contract artifacts (ABIs and addresses) for integration:

```bash
# Copy ABIs from smart contract repository
node scripts/update-contracts.js --copy-abi AaveFlashLoan

# Copy all ABIs
node scripts/update-contracts.js --copy-all

# Update contract addresses
node scripts/update-contracts.js --update-addresses
```

### Neon EVM Composability
The platform uses Neon EVM's unique composability feature that allows Solidity contracts to call Solana programs directly through the `ICallSolana` precompile at address `0xFF00000000000000000000000000000000000006`.
